# The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-Sample-Code

This Repo is used to store sample code from the book The Well Grounded Rubyist by David A Black (author), Joseph Leo (author).

This Repo isn't an official project but is used for study purposes. This repo doesn't include all code examples and exercises that are within the book. It is only for my own personal study uses only.
