# The Well Grounded Rubyist Sample Code

This Repo is used to store sample code from the book The Well Grounded Rubyist by David A Black (author), Joseph Leo (author).

This Repo isn't an official project but is used for study purposes. This repo doesn't include all code examples and exercises that are within the book. It is only for my own personal study uses only.

## List Of Completed Chapters (things in brackets are good things to remember from each chapter)
  Chapter 1: Bootstrapping your Ruby Literacy (How to use ***require***, ***require_relative***)
  
  Chapter 2: Objects, methods and local variables (Useful built in methods include ***object_id?***, ***respond_to?*** & ***send***)
  
  Chapter 3: Organising objects with classes (Explains instance variables eg ***@name***. Explains attr_* methods eg ***attr_reader :name***,  ***attr_setter :name***,  ***attr_accessor :name*** . In Ruby, an instance method provides functionality to an Object. A class method provides functionality to a class itself.)
  
  Chapter 4: Modules and program organization (How to use modules to express the design of a program. How to mix modules inside of a Class. The difference in using  ***include***, ***prepend*** & ***extend*** to mix in modules into classes. How to use ***super*** , ***super_method*** & ***method_missing***)
  
  Chapter 5: The default object (self), scope, and visibility (How to use ***self*** . Determining scope . Defining method access rules such as private methods ***private*** & protected methods ***protected :x***)
  
  Chapter 6: Control-flow techniques (This chapter covers Conditional execution ***if/unless*** , ***case/when*** , Loops and looping techniques ***loop*** ,  ***for*** , ***while*** & ***until*** , Iterators , Exceptions and error handling.)

  Chapter 7: Built-in essentials (This chapter moves through Literal Constructors, Syntactic Sugar, Dangerous And/Or Destructive Methods, Boolean States, Object-Comparison Techniques, Runtime Inspection Of Objects' Capabilities)
  
  Chapter 8: Strings, symbols, and otherscalar objects (This chatper covers String object creation and manipulation, Methods for transforming strings, The workings of symbols, String/symbol comparison, Time and date objects)
  
  Chapter 9: Collection and container objects (This chapter covers Sequentially ordered collections with arrays, Keyed collections with hashes, Inclusion and membership tests with ranges, Unique, unordered collections with sets, Named arguments using hash syntax)
  
  Chapter 10: Collections central: Enumerable and Enumerator (This chapter covers Mixing Enumerable into your classes, The use of Enumerable methods in collection objects, Strings as quasi-enumerable objects, Sorting enumerables with the Comparable module, Enumerators)
