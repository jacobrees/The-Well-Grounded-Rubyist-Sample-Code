# The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-Sample-Code

This Repo is used to store sample code from the book The Well Grounded Rubyist by David A Black (author), Joseph Leo (author).

This Repo isn't an official project but is used for study purposes. This repo doesn't include all code examples and exercises that are within the book. It is only for my own personal study uses only.

## List Of Completed Chapters (things in brackets are good things to remember from each chapter)
  Chapter 1: Bootstrapping your Ruby Literacy (How to use ***require***, ***require_relative***)
  
  Chapter 2: Objects, methods and local variables (Useful built in methods include ***object_id?***, ***respond_to?*** & ***send***)
  
  Chapter 3: Organising objects with classes (Explains instance variables eg ***@name***. Explains attr_* methods eg ***attr_reader :name***,  ***attr_setter :name***,  ***attr_accessor :name*** . In Ruby, an instance method provides functionality to an Object. A class method provides functionality to a class itself.)
  
  Chapter 4: Modules and program organization (How to use modules to express the design of a program. How to mix modules inside of a Class. The difference in using  ***include***, ***prepend*** & ***extend*** to mix in modules into classes. How to use ***super*** , ***super_method*** & ***method_missing***)
